    <h2>What is your website about?</h2>
    <li>

      be important?)
    </h2>
    <li>
      The objective is for my network to be able to view all of my
      accomplishments and use it as a resourse about me. This is important
      because it allows for more information and visual explaination than just a
      boring resume.

      The first page will show an image of myself and have overall information
      on myself such as location, professtional background, and extracurricular
      activities.
    </li>
    <li>
      The second page will include more specifics on some of my hobbies such as
      cars, music, and playing the clarinet.
    </li>
    <li>
      The third page will be all abou the volunteer work I have done and or am
      passionate about.
    </li>
    <li>

      consulting business from over the summer
